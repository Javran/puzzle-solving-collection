  Solver for https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takuzu

  Credit to game "0h h1" by Q42 for introducing me to this game.
  If you see a lot of mention of color blue and red instead
  of 0 and 1, that's why.

  The decision that blue=0 and red=1 is made because 'b' < 'r' alphabetically,
  this allows us to accept any raw table with ' ' and two more other characters
  in it, and assign 0,1 to these two characters in order.
  e.g. "101 " will result in the exact same input representation as "rbr ".
